# Confera

**Confera** is a free, open-source contact collection app designed for trade shows and exhibitions. With Confera, you can easily gather, save, and export attendee contact information offline (as connection may be faulty at trade shows), organized by timestamp for better follow-up and analysis.

## Features

- **Offline Contact Collection**: Collect attendee information with standard contact fields, notes, and an automatic timestamp, even without an internet connection.
- **Data Export**: Export saved contacts in JSON format, organized by day for easy reference and follow-up.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), Confera is compatible with both iOS and Android.

## Future planned features
- **QR Code Scanning**: Quickly add contacts by scanning attendee QR codes/bar codes.
- **Share your own contact as a QR code**: Share your contact as a saveable vCard which both Android and iOS natively support.
- **Export in different formats**: including csv.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
